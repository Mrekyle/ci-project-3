- Github - Used for the source control of the game.
- Codeanywhere - The cloud development spcae allowing for the creating and testing of the game
- Python - The programming language behind the app powering it
- Heroku - Used for the final deployment and hosting of the game. Allowing users to play and interact with the application using the base frame provided by Code Institute

### Testing

During the development of the game. There were may tests that were made along the way to ensure everything was working as intended and going to plan. 



Once the game was completed and everything was running as intended. The code way put through CI pip8 Python testing. 

### Bugs/Bug Fixes
