Hangman is a traditional game that has been around through the ages. Testing the knowledge of your opponents spelling. 
Either played online against a computer or against a friend on paper. But this version is all online and built and designed to run 
in the command line. Using Python programming language.

### How to play

Once the game has started the user is asked if they want to read the game instructions or just go ahead and play. 
Once they have decided wether to read or ignore, the user wis prompted to enter a username for the game.
They will then be asked what difficulty level they want to play 'Beginner, Novice, Advanced, Insanity'. All with 
varying levels of difficulty. 

The user then goes ahead and does there best to guess the secret word that has been selected from the difficulty level.
Trying to beat the gallows to win the game.

### Logic Flow Chart

### Features

The current features in the game are as follows. Allowing for the game to function as intended. 

- Game rules - To tell and instruct the user how to play the game and how the game works.

- Win and loose state - Giving different messages based on the outcnme of the game
- Game restart - Allowing the user to restart the game at the end once they have won or lost

### Future Development

The implemented features that are currently in the game allow it to run in the most simple form to get the job done and run the game of hangman for the players to be able play. But to keep things interesting and for future development of the game, features that could be added are:

- API - for new and totally random words
- Score board - So players can track there correct and wrong words (using a set amount of words in a game)
- Multiplayer - So users can play against there friends and family 
- New Word Topics - Allowing a user to select a word catagory and play with them words. Such as 'Animals'

### Technoligies Used

In the development of this project multiple technoligies were used to allow everything to function. 

- Github - Used for the source control of the game.
- Codeanywhere - The cloud development spcae allowing for the creating and testing of the game
- Python - The programming language behind the app powering it
- Heroku - Used for the final deployment and hosting of the game. Allowing users to play and interact with the application using the base frame provided by Code Institute

### Testing

During the development of the game. There were may tests that were made along the way to ensure everything was working as intended and going to plan. 

TABLE TO GO HERE

Once the game was completed and everything was running as intended. The code way put through CI pip8 Python testing.

### Bugs/Bug Fixes

During the development there were many bugs despite the constant testing of the game thoughout the development. With most of them being a minor fix, such as an indentation error or general spelling mistake some were requiring re writes of code. 

- Game not showing the game instructions despite the user enter 'y' to view them.

- Game not restarting when the user entered 'y' to restart the game at the end of the game.

### Deployment

Deployment of the game was done by using Heroku. Whilst hosting the files Github and linking the two together.
